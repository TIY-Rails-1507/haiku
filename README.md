# Haiku

This is a short lesson in handling merge conflicts in Git.

To do this we are going to all edit the same file, which may result in merge conflicts.

We will then have to resolve them.


### Tasks:

#### Step 1
Each person should clone this repo - do not fork it, only clone it.

On your local machine, open poem.txt and create a Haiku - there are no prizes so any 3 lines are good enough.

#### Step 2
Try to push this back to the repo.

You will probably get a message saying you need to get the latest version before you can push.

Do a pull and try to resolve any merge conflicts

Rules for merging
* You must keep at least one of the lines from your poem
* Must keep at least one of the lines from the version you pulled down
